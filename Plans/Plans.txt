Software Overview

This software is a small Python project created by Denver James Duran. It uses the following libraries:

Database: SQLite3
GUI: customtkinter
Error Checking: unittest, importlib, Logging
Encryption: bcrypt
Others: os, sys

The software has the following features:

Data cleaning: User inputs are sanitized to prevent common SQL injection attacks. Inputs are also parameterized before execution, which improves security.
Factory Design: Codes are separated as much as possible and objects are given unique names.
Error handling: Customized Exceptions with their own GUI dialogue and descriptive message allow end users to understand what is happening.
Logging: All customized errors are saved in an errors.log file within the project directory for backtracking of events.
Encryption: The bcrypt module is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords saved in the SQL database.

Possible Future Improvements
The following are possible future improvements for the software:

Integrate with a separate software: It would be more useful if this software could be linked to a bigger software, such as Sales Tracking.
Implement the Forgot Password link: A Forgot Password link could be implemented, which would allow users to reset their passwords by entering their email address.

Conclusion

This software is a small but powerful Python project that can be used 
for a variety of purposes. It is well-designed and secure, and it has 
the potential to be even more useful with future improvements.
